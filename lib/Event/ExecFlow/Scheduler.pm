=head1 NAME

Event::ExecFlow::Scheduler - Abstract class for parallel scheduling

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #-- Create a new Scheduler object
  my $scheduler = Event::ExecFlow::Scheduler::XYZ->new ( ... );

  #-- Attach scheduler to a group job with parallel execution
  $group_job->set_parallel(1);
  $group_job->set_scheduler($scheduler);

  #-- The following methods gets called by Event::ExecFlow
  #-- at runtime
  $scheduler->schedule_job($job);
  $scheduler->job_finished($job);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This abstract base class represents just an interface which
needs to be implemented by custom schedulers for controlling
the execution of jobs in a Event::ExecFlow::Group which has
the parallel option set.

Event::ExecFlow ships a very simple example for a scheduler
which just limits the maximum number of parallel executed
jobs: Event::ExecFlow::Scheduler::SimpleMax.
