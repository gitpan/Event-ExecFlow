    Bugfixes:
    - Accumulated group member errors were not reported to
      the frontend.

      instead of forking.
    
0.63 Fri Apr 13, 2007, joern
    Features:
    - Improved output layout of Event::ExecFlow::Term.
    - Event::ExecFlow::Frontend::Term->set_quiet(1)
      will print just warning and error messages.
    - Added method Event::ExecFlow::Job->reset()
    
    Bugfixes:
    - Increase group progress on child finish only when
      it was successful.
    - Group considered itself finished even when a child

0.62 Sat Jun 17, 2006, joern
    Features:
    - Executed programs are now set into C locale, so parsing
      output is independent from the locale settings.
    
    Bugfix:
    - set job into error state if post callbacks return
      with error.

    Notes:
    - First public CPAN release
